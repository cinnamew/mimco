# Miss Inconspicuous Maid Girl Cleaning Co.!

Hey guys, this is the repo for MIMCO. DO NOT use anything from here without our permission first (you can reach out to me at cinnamew.art (at) gmail.com ).


For translators
-
*Contact me at my email or reach out on Discord @cinnamew if you're interested <3*
- You'll just be adding things to CSVs and sending them back to me!
- The most updated CSVs are usually in Assets -> Localization -> Flowchart CSVs.
- Languages were added in the order: pt-Br, Uk, Ru, zh-TW (the folder you should look at will likely have the name of the latest language added).
- You just need to add a column to all the CSVs and translate!
  - You might want to be a little careful if there are repeats, things may be a little messy (like there might be a Final.csv and RealFinal.csv or smth LOL)
- There is one more CSV that is not in there; it's all the non-dialogue text! Ask me for this, I'll send it separately.
- TRANSLATION NOTES
  - Leave things in curly braces (i.e. {wc}, {wi}, {/i}, etc) untouched. You can translate everything else :)
  - Please keep choices & "thingstofix" relatively shorter/match the length of the Ukrainian ver (the longest one lol) -- otherwise I need to resize stuff D:
  - Talk to me! Let me know if anything's confusing! Feel free to mess around with the wording of things; you are the native here (or at least know more about the language than me)! I love hearing about little quirks in languages, like changing "you" from formal to informal or "What the melon!?" into something that makes sense and is just as silly. There are a few things with hidden meanings I put in there (e.x. the cherries, the type of wood, etc -- it's all in a Google doc I can send you, so please ask for it), so probably don't change too much of the meaning, but get the gist of things and I will be very happy :)
